## About Me
I am currently a first year master's student in mathematics, in a program dedicated to algebra, geometry and number theory called ALGANT. I still have to find my way, but I enjoy solving problems and discovering things I didn't know. I am currently trying to figure out what I might like to pursue in my thesis. The areas that are intriguing me the most are algebraic geometry and number theory (I am intrigued by resolution of singularities and rational points on things that come to hand).
